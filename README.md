# Transliteration is possibly the most foundational and sustainable impactive endowment that the internationalization community, which hit a significant milestone acknowledgement in the foray of enterprise and open-source softwzre development on mobile in 2018, with Google's Annual i|o:18 conference. Transliteration was currently offered a first-person feedback offering of that it is intensive. I had personally branded it « breakout » development, in of that it could similarly be a post-visual-strata linear form, such as electricity offers; in development in Big Tech Corporate terms, it would otherwise be known as "Grand Central'ing," symbolized by the percutaneuous orthographies of the such so-as, to imagine: DaVinci's Duodecahecadron (sic.) many-faring Hedron-sided geometries (also, of the classical Sacred Geometry mathemetician-philosophers) and the multiplicities of shades of nuance,of the Grand Central: here, known as « semaphore », which is essentially a natural object shape, similar to a gravel-grade oyster's pearl, whereas the Grand Central [practice] is a band-marching signaling triage, with (I believe) 36 dynamics of flag-bearing signaling apparatus, as a sign-language, within it's contextual origin, yet; within the eccentricities and nuance of the Big Corporate Tech giants' App Store|s|, there exists such folklorish blog consequential transliterative content, as iPigeon.institute.
